# VNStravelling-salesman-problem
Solving the Simetric Travelling Salesman Problem Using Variable Neighborhood Search, coded in C.
This code was made for the second assignment for the class of Projects and Analisis of Algorithms at Insituto Federal Fluminense, in Campos dos Goytacazes - RJ, Brazil.

To run this code you only need to be able to run C, and select the "grafo.txt" that you want to use. The algorithm must take as input a .txt file that contains, in the first line, the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph (separated by space). The subsequent lines store the distance matrix D, where the element dij stores the distance from city i to city j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n).

See and example below: 

4 6<br>
0 7 1 3<br>
7 0 5 8<br>
1 5 0 6<br>
3 8 6 0<br>
